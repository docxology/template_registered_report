# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

A registered report separates *what a study commits to* from *what the data
later show*. Hypotheses, outcomes, exclusion rules, and the analysis plan are
locked and time-stamped before results are observed; only then is the analysis
run and interpreted. This ordering is the structural defence against the
degrees-of-freedom problems that inflate false-positive rates in flexible
analyses [@simmons2011false] and motivates the broader preregistration and
research-transparency movement [@nosek2018preregistration; @munafo2017manifesto;
@chambers2013registered].

This template operationalises that discipline as tested code rather than prose
convention. The `registered_report` package freezes a registration payload
under a content hash, validates that the required preregistration sections are
present and well formed, and — after execution — compares the analysis that was
actually run against the plan that was locked. Any departure must appear in a
**deviation ledger** with a rationale before it can be reported, and confirmatory
claims are kept mechanically distinct from exploratory ones.

To make the workflow concrete and reproducible, the template ships a
**deterministic demonstration study**. It contains no real empirical data: a
seeded generator synthesises a two-group dataset, and the registered
label-permutation test is executed against it. Because both the data and the
permutation schedule are seeded, every figure and every number in this document
is byte-stable and is regenerated on demand from
`scripts/generate_figures.py`. Readers forking this template should replace the
demonstration fixture in `data/example_registration.json` and the synthetic
data generator with their own registration and real data collection, keeping the
same lock-validate-execute-compare structure.

The remainder of this report states the preregistered hypotheses
([Section @sec:hypotheses]), describes the frozen methods and analysis plan
([Section @sec:methods]), reports the confirmatory outcome bound to the
executed analysis ([Section @sec:results]), records deviations
([Section @sec:deviations]), and discusses scope and boundaries
([Section @sec:discussion]).
